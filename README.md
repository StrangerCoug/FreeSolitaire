# Welcome to the FreeSolitaire project!
This is planned to be a free and open source cross-platform Java solitaire program. I am still working on the basic structure, but the following games are planned for its initial release:
1. Canfield
2. Clock
3. Forty Thieves
4. FreeCell
5. Golf
6. Klondike
7. La Belle Lucie
8. Scorpion
9. Spider
10. Pyramid
11. TriPeaks
12. Yukon

I am open to adding more games over time, but I think this is a good set of games to start with.

Feel free to chip in if you'd like to help! Please read the [contributing guidelines](/CONTRIBUTING.md) before you begin. This is a [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) project; therefore, you will need Maven to build the program.
